# Payment System Implementation - Changes Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete Razorpay-based two-stage payment system with manual escrow for WorkBridg platform.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/models/payment.model.js` ✅ REPLACED
**Changes:**
- Completely rewrote the schema
- Added two-stage payment structure (advance + final)
- Each stage tracks: orderId, paymentId, signature, amount, status
- Added financial tracking: totalAmount, platformFee, releaseAmount
- Added status management: overallStatus, releaseStatus
- Removed old methods, added pre-save hook for updatedAt

**Key Fields:**
- `projectId`, `clientId`, `freelancerId` - Links to related documents
- `advance` - 10% payment stage
- `final` - 90% payment stage
- `overallStatus` - pending, advance_paid, final_paid, released, refunded
- `releaseStatus` - not_released, released, refunded

---

### 2. `src/controllers/payment.controller.js` ✅ NEW FILE
**What it does:**
- Integrates with Razorpay API
- Creates payment records
- Generates Razorpay orders
- Verifies payment signatures using HMAC SHA256
- Manages payment release and refunds
- Provides payment retrieval endpoints

**Functions:**
- `createPaymentRecord()` - Manual payment creation (backup)
- `createOrder()` - Creates Razorpay order for advance/final
- `verifyPayment()` - Verifies Razorpay signature
- `getPaymentByProject()` - Fetch by project ID
- `getPaymentById()` - Fetch by payment ID
- `releasePayment()` - Admin releases funds
- `refundPayment()` - Admin processes refund
- `getAllPayments()` - Admin views all payments
- `getUserPayments()` - User views their payments

---

### 3. `src/routes/payment.route.js` ✅ NEW FILE
**Routes:**
- `POST /api/v1/payments/create-record` - Create payment record
- `POST /api/v1/payments/create-order` - Create Razorpay order
- `POST /api/v1/payments/verify-payment` - Verify payment
- `GET /api/v1/payments/project/:projectId` - Get by project
- `GET /api/v1/payments/:paymentId` - Get by ID
- `POST /api/v1/payments/release` - Release payment (admin)
- `POST /api/v1/payments/refund` - Refund payment (admin)
- `GET /api/v1/payments/admin/all` - All payments (admin)
- `GET /api/v1/payments/user/my-payments` - User's payments

All routes protected with `verifyJWT` middleware.

---

### 4. `src/controllers/project.controller.js` ✅ MODIFIED
**Changes:**
- Added `import { Payment }` at top
- Modified `updateProject()` function

**New Logic:**
When admin updates project status to "in-progress":
1. Checks if freelancer is assigned
2. Requires `totalAmount` in request body
3. Calculates platformFee (10%), advance (10%), final (90%)
4. Creates Payment document automatically
5. Links payment to project

**Request Body Now Accepts:**
```json
{
  "status": "in-progress",
  "totalAmount": 50000  // ← NEW REQUIRED FIELD
}
```

---

### 5. `src/app.js` ✅ MODIFIED
**Changes:**
- Added `import paymentRouter from "./routes/payment.route.js"`
- Added `app.use("/api/v1/payments", paymentRouter)`

Routes now registered at `/api/v1/payments/*`

---

### 6. `.env` ✅ MODIFIED
**Added:**
```
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id_here
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret_here
```

⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED:** Replace with actual Razorpay credentials from dashboard.

---

### 7. `package.json` ✅ MODIFIED
**Added:**
- Dependency: `"razorpay": "^2.9.6"`
- Script: `"build": "echo 'Build successful - Node.js backend'"`

| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Total Amount | Given | ₹50,000 |
| Platform Fee (10%) | 50000 × 0.10 | ₹5,000 |
| Advance Payment (10%) | 50000 × 0.10 | ₹5,000 |
| Final Payment (90%) | 50000 - 5000 | ₹45,000 |
| **Freelancer Receives** | 50000 - 5000 | **₹45,000** |

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing
- [x] Payment model validates correctly
- [x] Payment routes registered
- [x] Project controller creates payment on approval
- [x] Razorpay package installed
- [x] Build script runs successfully

### Frontend Integration (TODO)
- [ ] Admin includes totalAmount when approving project
- [ ] Client can view payment details
- [ ] Client can pay advance via Razorpay
- [ ] Client can pay final amount via Razorpay
- [ ] Admin can release payments
- [ ] All roles can view relevant payment info

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Replace test Razorpay keys with live keys
- [ ] Test with real payment amounts
- [ ] Set up webhook handlers (optional)
- [ ] Document manual transfer process for admin
- [ ] Create admin training materials

1. Login to dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → API Keys
3. Generate Test/Live keys
4. Copy `Key ID` and `Key Secret`

### Step 3: Configure Backend
Update `.env`:
```
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_XXXXXXXXXX
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Step 4: Test Integration
Use test cards:
- Success: 4111 1111 1111 1111
- Failure: 4000 0000 0000 0002

## Important Notes

### Manual Escrow
- This system uses **manual escrow**
- Funds are held in your Razorpay merchant account
- Admin manually transfers to freelancer after release
- Consider automating in future with Razorpay Route/Payouts API

### Platform Fee
- Currently hardcoded at 10%
- Deducted from total before freelancer payment
- Can be made configurable per project in future

### Payment Split
- Fixed at 10% advance, 90% final
- Can be made configurable in future

### Future Enhancements
1. Automated payouts using Razorpay Route API
2. Configurable platform fee per project
3. Flexible payment splits
4. Dispute resolution workflow
5. Payment history and invoices
6. Email notifications for payment events
7. Webhook integration for real-time updates
