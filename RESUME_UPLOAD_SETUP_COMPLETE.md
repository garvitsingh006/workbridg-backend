```

### 2. Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### 3. Enable Rate Limiting (Optional)
After installing `express-rate-limit`, uncomment the rate limiting code in `upload.route.js`:

## API Endpoints

### Upload Resume
```
POST /api/v1/upload/resume
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body: file (form field name: 'file')
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "data": {
    "url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
    "publicId": "resume_userId_timestamp",
    "originalName": "resume.pdf",
    "size": 1234567
  },
  "message": "File uploaded successfully",
  "success": true
}
```

**Note:** Automatically updates the user's `resume` field in the database with the uploaded file URL.

### Get Resume Info
```
GET /api/v1/upload/resume/info
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "data": {
    "hasResume": true,
    "resumeUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/..."
  },
  "message": "Resume info retrieved successfully",
  "success": true
}
```

### Delete Resume
```
DELETE /api/v1/upload/resume/:publicId

  "data": null,
  "message": "File deleted successfully",
  "success": true
}
```

**Note:** Automatically clears the user's `resume` field in the database.

## Frontend Integration

The frontend should make requests to:
- **Upload**: `POST /api/v1/upload/resume`
- **Delete**: `DELETE /api/v1/upload/resume/{publicId}`

Make sure to include the JWT token in the Authorization header:
```javascript
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
}
```

## Security Features Implemented

- ‚úÖ JWT Authentication required
- ‚úÖ File type validation (PDF, DOC, DOCX only)
- ‚úÖ File size limits (10MB max)
- ‚úÖ Secure Cloudinary URLs
- ‚úÖ Error handling for all edge cases
- ‚è≥ Rate limiting (ready to enable)

## Testing

You can test the endpoints using:
1. Postman/Insomnia
2. Frontend file upload component
3. cURL commands

Example cURL:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/upload/resume \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN' \
  -F 'file=@/path/to/resume.pdf'
```

## Status: READY FOR USE üöÄ

The resume upload backend is now fully implemented and ready for frontend integration. Just install the missing dependencies and ensure your environment variables are set up correctly.
